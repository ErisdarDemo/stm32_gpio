# stm32_gpio Demonstration Reference Project

Welcome to the STM32_Gpio project! This repository is a comprehensive demonstration reference for the STM32H743 series, designed to showcase advanced embedded development skills and serve as a resource for both educational and professional purposes.

## Project Overview

- **Target MCU:** STM32H743IIT6 (Waveshare OpenH743I-C board)
- **Development Tools:** STM32CubeIDE, EWARM (IAR), MDK-ARM (Keil)
- **Features:** GPIO control, modular drivers, CMSIS integration, utilities, and example applications

## Directory Structure

- **Doc/**: Documentation, datasheets, and reference materials
- **Drivers/**: Board support packages, CMSIS, and HAL drivers
- **EWARM/**: IAR Embedded Workbench project files and startup code
- **Inc/**: Project header files
- **MDK-ARM/**: Keil project files and startup code
- **Src/**: Main source files and interrupt handlers
- **STM32CubeIDE/**: CubeIDE project files, linker scripts, and debug outputs
- **Utilities/**: Utility modules (CPU, fonts, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (STM32CubeIDE, IAR, or Keil)
3. Build and flash to the STM32H743 board

## Opens
