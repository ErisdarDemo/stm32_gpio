# Inc Directory

This directory contains all project header files for the Open743_GPIO STM32 demonstration project.

## Structure
- **main.h**: Main application header.
- **stm32h7xx_hal_conf.h**: HAL configuration header for STM32H7xx series.
- **stm32h7xx_it.h**: Interrupt handler header.
- **stm32h7xx_nucleo_conf.h**: Nucleo board configuration header.

## Purpose
The Inc directory centralizes all header files, making it easy to manage project-wide definitions, configurations, and interface declarations. This supports modularity and maintainability.
