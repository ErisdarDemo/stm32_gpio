# STM32CubeIDE Directory

This directory contains project files, linker scripts, and debug outputs for STM32CubeIDE.

## Structure
- **Open743_GPIO.launch**: Launch configuration for STM32CubeIDE.
- **STM32H743ZITX_FLASH.ld**: Linker script for STM32H743 flash memory.
- **Debug/**: Build outputs, makefiles, and object lists for debugging.

## Purpose
The STM32CubeIDE directory enables development, debugging, and deployment of the Open743_GPIO project using STM32CubeIDE. It provides all necessary files for compiling, linking, and running the project on STM32 hardware.
