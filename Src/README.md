# Src Directory

This directory contains the main source code files for the Open743_GPIO STM32 demonstration project.

## Structure
- **main.c**: Main application source file.
- **stm32h7xx_it.c**: Interrupt handler implementations.
- **system_stm32h7xx.c**: System initialization and configuration code.

## Purpose
The Src directory is the core of the project, containing all application logic, interrupt routines, and system setup code. It demonstrates modular embedded C programming and integration with STM32 HAL and CMSIS drivers.
