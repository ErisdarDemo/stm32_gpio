# Drivers Directory

This directory contains all hardware abstraction and peripheral drivers required for the Open743_GPIO STM32 demonstration project.

## Structure
- **BSP/**: Board Support Package for STM32H7xx Nucleo boards, including configuration, error handling, and user manuals.
- **CMSIS/**: ARM CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) headers and device files for STM32.
- **STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver/**: STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers for peripheral control and integration.

## Purpose
The Drivers directory provides modular, reusable code for hardware interfacing, making it easy to add, modify, or extend support for new peripherals and boards.
